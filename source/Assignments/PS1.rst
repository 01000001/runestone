Problem Set 1
--------------------------
**Due:** **Friday, January 17, 5 pm**

**Instructions:** Write the code you want to save in the provided boxes, and click **save**. The last code you have saved by the deadline is what will be graded.

1. (1 pt) Given the following code, write an expression that will have the value ``"o"``, using ``s``. 

   .. actex:: hw_1_1

       s = "Hello, all"
	   
	   

#. (1 pt) Write code to print this string WITHOUT any ``&`` signs.

      This is a really fun&& homework assign&ment. And & I love&& &&Python.

   .. actex:: hw_1_2
   
   		# Here's the string provided for you
   		nst = "This is a really fun&& homework assign&ment. And & I love&& &&Python."
		
		# Write your code to print this string without any "&s", below:
		

#. (1 pt) What is the first index of the letter "h" in this sentence? Write code to find it, and print it. (Remember, an index is the __th element of a string or a list, for example.)

      This is a really fun homework assigment, and I love Python.

   .. actex:: hw_1_3
   
   		# Here's the sentence, provided for you
   		st = "This is a really fun homework assigment, and I love Python."
		
		## Write your code to find the first index of the letter "h" below:
   

#. (3 pts) See comments for instructions.

   .. actex:: hw_1_4
		
		abc = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
		
		# What type of value is in the variable abc? 
		# Write code to find out what type the value of abc is.
		
		## Write the type here: _______
		
		# write code to extract and print the first three elements of abc
		
		# write code to extract and print the last element of abc
		
		# write code to extract and print the number 4 from abc
		
		# write code to extract and print the number 6 from abc
		
		# write code to find out what type the first element of abc is, and print it.



#. (2 pts) See the comments for instructions.

   .. actex:: hw_1_5
   
		xy_lst = ["hello","goodbye","welcome","106","si 106"]
		abc_sentence = "Welcome to SI 106, everyone."
		
		# write code to extract and print the first element of xy_lst
		
		# write code to extract and print the last element of xy_lst
		
		# write code to extract and print the first element of abc_sentence
		
		# write code to extract and print the last element of abc_sentence


#. (2 pts) See the comments for instructions.

   .. actex:: hw_1_6
   
		xy_lst = ["hello","goodbye","welcome","106","si 106"]
		abc_sentence = "Welcome to SI 106, everyone."
		
		# write code to extract and print the first element of xy_lst
		
		# write code to extract and print the last element of xy_lst
		
		# write code to extract and print the first element of abc_sentence
		
		# write code to extract and print the last element of abc_sentence	
		
			
#. (2 pts) Write code to ask the user for their name and print out ``"Hello, <THEIR NAME>"``

   .. actex:: hw_1_7
   
		# For example, if you enter "Nick", your code should then print "Hello, Nick"
